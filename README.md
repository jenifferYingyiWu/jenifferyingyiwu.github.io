# Digital Artist

<p> 
    <font size="8"> Dearest All, </font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="6"> I am a digital artist who loves painting. With 13 years of software development experience, I never gave up on my digital art dreams. I bravely showcase my unique skills and characteristics, courageously pursuing my dreams and goals. </font>       
</p>
<p>
    <font size="6"> I have a strong interest in "concept design," "Maya modeling," and "Unreal Engine." I am passionate about combining traditional Chinese ink painting with digital art, breathing new life and vitality into thousands of years of Chinese painting. </font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="6"> I hope to become friends with digital artists around the world, exploring creative digital art portfolios together. At the same time, I am willing to share my digital art portfolio, contributing to a healthy, harmonious, open, and inclusive digital art ecosystem. </font>
</p>

<p> 
    <font size="8"> Warmest Regards, </font>
