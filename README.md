# World-Class CG Artist

<p> 
    <font size="8"> Hello everyone, </font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="6"> As a globally recognized CG artist with a deep professional background in AI, my unwavering passion for art has driven my career forward. With 13 years of experience in software development, I've never lost sight of my dream to work in CG art. I’m incredibly proud to share my unique skills and perspectives cultivated through relentless dedication. </font>       
</p>
<p>
    <font size="6"> My interests span concept design (2D and 3D illustration), character and environment art in Photoshop, character sculpting in Maya and ZBrush, scene modeling in Blender, and rendering in Unreal Engine 5.4. One of my greatest passions lies in blending traditional Chinese ink painting with CG art—a fusion that breathes new life into centuries-old Chinese art, creating something truly unique and innovative. </font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="6"> I’m eager to connect with CG artists from around the globe, engage in creative discussions, and explore diverse portfolios. I look forward to sharing my work and contributing to a healthy, harmonious, open, and inclusive CG art ecosystem. Together, we can push the boundaries of creativity. </font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="6"> Let’s create something extraordinary! </font>
