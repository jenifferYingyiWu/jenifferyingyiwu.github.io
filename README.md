    <font size="8"> Dear All, </font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="6"> I am a digital artist with a deep passion for painting. Despite having 13 years of experience in software development, I have never given up on my dreams in digital art. I courageously showcase my unique talents and characteristics, relentlessly pursuing my dreams and goals. </font>       
</p>
<p>
    <font size="6"> I have a keen interest in concept design, Maya modeling, and Unreal Engine. I am particularly passionate about blending traditional Chinese ink painting with digital art, breathing new life and vitality into centuries-old Chinese art. </font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="6"> I aspire to connect with digital artists around the globe, engaging in creative discussions and exploring innovative digital art portfolios together. I am also eager to share my own digital art portfolio, fostering a healthy, harmonious, open, and inclusive digital art ecosystem. </font>
